# work-less

This app allows users to maximise their consecutive time off based on their country's public holidays and their available leave days.

It is a Lerna monorepo built with ReactXP and Typescript. It includes a web app and React-Native android and iOS apps, all built using the same source code.

This project will not run as it still needs some work around the Firebase config which was removed to make this repo public.
